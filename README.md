- 👨‍🎓 Hi! My name is Arunmozhi, and now I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Industrial Engineering from the School of Mechanical Engineering, VIT University in Vellore, India. I completed my Master's Degree in Industrial Engineering.

- 💞️ I'm interested in research areas like Optimization, decision-making, structural equation modeling, mass customization, operation management, heuristics, and meta-heuristics for developing mathematical representations of challenges in management and industrial engineering.

- 🌱 I am presently engaged in the study of Reinforcement Learning and Perspective Analytics, focusing on its application to Industrial Engineering challenges.
  
- 👀 I'm looking to collaborate on Optimization within a Mass Customized Environment or Structural Equation Model for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
